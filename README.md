HEARTS GAME

This is a hearts card game created in C# for our Major Project in OOP3 at Durham College.

The game was designed to have the base functionality of a game of hearts, as well as themes and other design elements. The purpose of the assignment was to showcase our knowledge of object oriented programing.
